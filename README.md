## About

`isitup` is a simple web application to check whether a site is ðŸ†™ or broken.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install all dependencies by running:

```
git clone https://github.com/nicholasadamou/isitup
cd isitup/
yarn install
```

Subsequently, create a `.env` file and declare a variable called `SECRET` (for session security purposes):

```
echo "SECRET=[your-secret-goes-here]" > .env
```

Finally, build the project by running:

```
yarn start
```

If you want to use [`docker`](https://docker.com) then  you can do the follow:

```
# Make sure you have docker installed before running the below commands.
# See https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

make all
docker-compose up
```

You can then access the service by navigating to [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000/).
